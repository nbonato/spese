# Spese

Spese is a simple PWA to track expeneses (which translates to "spese" in Italian). I am creating it to have a simple, clean and local solution to track my own expenses. It is also an opportunity for me to learn more about PWA.

If you stumble upon it, feel free to use it, but it's still very much a work in progress.
